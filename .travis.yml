# Inspired from the .travis.yml in
# https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep/

# This script can be executed in three different modes:
# - cron/api (api is when you select 'trigger build' in travis): in this mode,
#   all the formulas are tested to make sure that there is no shared lib
#   breakage
# - push to master: in this mode, the updated formulas are built and bottled
#   and the bottles are pushed to bintray, commited and pushed.
# - pull-request: same as 'push on master' but without bintray and commit.

language: ruby
if: tag IS blank # build is disabled on tags (no rationale actually)
env:
  global:
    - HOMEBREW_BINTRAY_USER=maelvalais
    - TAP_BOTTLE_DOMAIN=https://dl.bintray.com/maelvalais
    # Beyond these global variables, you also need to set some secret variables
    # in your travis-ci settings:
    # - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    # - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY          (for the AWS S3 bucket)
    # - GITHUB_TOKEN                   (for pushing bottle DSL commits)
    # - HOMEBREW_BINTRAY_KEY           (for the Bintray repo)

# Note: I removed $HOME/Library/Caches/Homebrew from the caches
# because it was enormous (~2GB for the 4 jobs). This is because
# this folder is already present on osx images and it is big.
# Note2: I also removed $HOME/.cache/Homebrew (cache of Linuxbrew)
# because it was also storing some logs, making the cache rebuilt
# every time.

  # Oauth github + https (only ssh) so I use my own.
  - brew tap maelvalais/test-bot

  # IMPORTANT STEP: link the tap inside brew to our current travis-cloned tap
  # Step: 1) create the intermediate folders <user>/<repo> so that
  # we can 2) remove <repo> and 3) replace it with a sym link
  # that will point to the travis build folder.
  # If we don't do that, the tap be cloned using the default master
  # branch, and thus we cannot test our tap at the current pushed commit.
  # We also need to unshallow in 4) because sometimes travis does not
  # clone thouroughly but we need a deep clone.
  - mkdir -p $(brew --repo $TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG)   # 1)
  - rm -rf $(brew --repo $TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG)     # 2)
  - ln -s $PWD $(brew --repo $TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG) # 3)
  - git fetch --unshallow || true               # 4)

  # 'brew doctor' must be run under HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=1. Otherwise,
  # it returns 1 with the message "this osx version is outdated" on old osx ver.
  - HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=1 brew doctor
  # Note on HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER: I don't want to put in env.global because
  # it should be '1' only during test-bot. If it is '1' during
  # brew cask uninstall... it will fail on the deprecation notice.
  # Unless I am in 'brew test-bot', I don't want to fail on warnings.

# WARNING: I discovered that 'set -e' is breaking Travis CI. I was using for
# stopping a multiple-lines command as soon as one of the commands fails.
# After having 'set -e', internal travis commands may stop working, e.g.:
#   /Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: line 57: shell_session_update: command not found
# is an internal error that shouldn't stop the script for continuing, but
# because of 'set -e', the whole internal Travis CI script stops.
# Conclusion: avoid using 'set -e' and more generally avoid for-loops and
# multi-line commands that should fail when one of the commands fails.
