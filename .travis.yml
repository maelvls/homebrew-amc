# Inspired from the .travis.yml in
# https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep/

# This script can be executed in three different modes:
# - cron/api (api is when you select 'trigger build' in travis): in this mode,
#   all the formulas are tested to make sure that there is no shared lib
#   breakage
# - push to master: in this mode, the updated formulas are built and bottled
#   and the bottles are pushed to bintray, commited and pushed.
# - pull-request: same as 'push on master' but without bintray and commit.

language: ruby
if: tag IS blank # build is disabled on tags (no rationale actually)

    # Beyond these global variables, you also need to set some secret variables
    # in your travis-ci settings:
    # - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    # - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY          (for the AWS S3 bucket)
    # - GITHUB_TOKEN                   (for pushing bottle DSL commits)
    # - HOMEBREW_BINTRAY_KEY           (for the Bintray repo)

# Note: I removed $HOME/Library/Caches/Homebrew from the caches
# because it was enormous (~2GB for the 4 jobs). This is because
# this folder is already present on osx images and it is big.
# Note2: I also removed $HOME/.cache/Homebrew (cache of Linuxbrew)
# because it was also storing some logs, making the cache rebuilt
# every time.

  # that will point to the travis build folder.
  # If we don't do that, the tap be cloned using the default master
  # branch, and thus we cannot test our tap at the current pushed commit.
  # We also need to unshallow in 4) because sometimes travis does not
  # clone thouroughly but we need a deep clone.
